4. **Show Business Impact**: Quantify revenue opportunity or risk
5. **Use Marketing Frameworks**: Reference Jobs-to-be-Done, positioning theory, segmentation best practices

FOR EACH INSIGHT, PROVIDE:
{
  "type": "opportunity" | "risk" | "strategy" | "finding",
  "category": "market" | "pricing" | "positioning" | "segmentation" | "channel" | "timing" | "product",
  "priority": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "title": "Compelling headline (8-12 words)",
  "summary": "One-sentence takeaway",
  "description": "3-4 paragraphs with specific numbers, business context, root cause analysis, and actionable recommendations",

    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Every number must be derived from the actual response data provided
- No generic statements like "customers want quality" - be SPECIFIC
- Every insight must have a "so what?" - why does this matter to the business?
- Use marketing terminology: TAM/SAM/SOM, CAC, LTV, positioning, differentiation, etc.
- Reference psychological principles: loss aversion, social proof, anchoring, etc.
- Think like a strategy consultant, not a data analyst
