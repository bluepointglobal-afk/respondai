```bash
# Start simulation via API
POST /api/test/[testId]/simulation
{
  "mode": "synthetic",
  "sampleSize": 100
}
```

### 3. **Verify Data Flow**
```bash
# Test data extractor
npm run test:data-extractor

# Verify complete flow
npm run verify:data-flow [testId]
```

### 4. **Check Analysis Results**
- ✅ Analysis mentions YOUR product name (not "Grass fed protein whey ultra purified")
- ✅ Insights reference YOUR validation goals
- ✅ Personas match YOUR target audience segments
- ✅ Recommendations address YOUR specific market
- ✅ All metrics calculated from YOUR response data
